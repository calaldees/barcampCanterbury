* Some rooms will have recording equipment running (clearly marked) should you want your talk recorded.
* Talk slots are up to 30 mins.

### Themed Treasure Hunt

* At this year's event there will be a treasure hunt. You will be placed in 1 of 4 elemental tribes and between talks your team will try to solve puzzles to prevent a great catastrophe!
* The first attendees to arrive will be provided with an interactive digital BarCamp badge that form part of the puzzle. We have a limited supply of badges, so if you want to participate in the treasure hunt, please arrive promptly.

## What to bring

### Items for the _Swap Shop_

If you have any small working components, items or tools you think anyone else could use for any projects please bring them to the event for the swap shop.

### Possible ideas for a talk

Please bring ideas for talks! Talks are informal and can be on (almost) any topic you like. The best talks are those on accessible topics that will appeal to the diverse audience we expect to attend the event. Talks could also be interactive, more like a discussion session. We are flexible in this regard!
