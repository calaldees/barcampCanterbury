* All talk rooms have a projector with HDMI connectivity. (There may be whiteboards available)
* Talk slots are up to 30 mins.
* One room may be setup with video recording equipment where the presenter can be recorded. This is optional. The room will be clearly marked/advertised.

### What to talk about?

Talks are informal and can be on (almost) any topic you like. The best talks are those on accessible topics that will appeal to the diverse audience we expect to attend the event. A PowerPoint isn't required. Talks can be off the cuff, on the spot, interactive, more like a discussion session.

### Food and drink

* Lunch is at 1pm. Pizza. (Provided free by our amazing supporters [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/))
    * There will be vegan and vegetarian options available.
    * (As this an event that is run on community donations, we may not be able to cater for all specialist dietary needs)
