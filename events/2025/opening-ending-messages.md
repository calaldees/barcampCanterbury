Closing
=======

* Venues
    * Universities have supported our community for many years, but there are less staff that understand BarCamp and it's value
    * We're moving to pay for our own venues - it's more expensive, but gives us freedom. We want a regular home.
* BarCamps are as good as there attendees - Spread the word - you are the most powerful way of spreading the BarCamp word.
* You could watch Netflix, but BarCamps are 'Active participation'. We need to encourage people to be part of what we have. Especially the young
* Next year ...

* Next year 11th April 2026 Barton Court
* Hope to encourage more students and a-level/college students
