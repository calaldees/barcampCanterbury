## What to expect

* This years BarCamp Canterbury is in a smaller more intimate venue.
* This will create a new subtle flavour to the event.

### Venue

* The Long Rest
* 8 Butchery Lane, Canterbury, United Kingdom, CT1 2JR
* https://www.thelongrestcanterbury.com/
* [openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.278641/1.081728)
* [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zN4Xmpyda27vGSLTA)

### 2 talk rooms and set of focused tables

* On the day a timetable will be setup on a blank space of wall
    * People will 'reserve a room/table slot' with a post-it note containing a title and the name of the presenter
* Talk/focus slots are up to 30 mins.
* A 'Focused Table' is much like a normal BarCamp talk room, but will have 6-ish seats.

### What to talk about?

* Talks are informal and can be on (almost) any topic you like, loosely themed around technology.
* The best talks are those that are made accessible/appeal to the diverse audience (Talks can still be technical and 'Infomazing' but should consider the audience).
* A PowerPoint isn't required. Talks can be off the cuff, on the spot, interactive, more like a discussion session.
* Good talks are driven by raw passion, interest and excitement rather than reading from a script.

### Schedule Overview

* 10:00 Attendees start to arrive
* 10:30 Introduction/Opening Talk
* 11:00 Talks part 1
* 13:00 Lunch
* 14:00 Talks part 2 (The return of the talk)
* 15:30 Closing Talk (and short PowerPoint Karaoke)
* 16:00+ Continue the conversation in town?

### Food and drink

* Refreshments are provided free of charge thanks to members of our community donating.
* Lunch is at 1pm.
    * There will be vegan and vegetarian options available.
    * (As this an event that is run on community donations, we may not be able to cater for all specialist dietary needs)

## What to bring

There will be a _table of wonder_. The Swap Shop.
Help yourself to free items at the "Swap Shop"!

### Exhibits

* We love it when people bring interesting items or things they have constructed.
* Feel free to bring items you want to demo/exhibit.
* This year, because space is limited, consider bringing smaller items.
