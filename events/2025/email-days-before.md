## What to expect

This years BarCamp Canterbury is in a smaller more intimate venue.
This will create a new subtle flavor to the event.

### 2 talk rooms and set of focused tables

* On the day a timetable will be setup on a blank space of wall
    * People will 'reserve a room/table slot' with a post-it note containing a title and the name of the presenter
* Talk/focus slots are up to 30 mins.
* A 'Focused Table' is much like a normal BarCamp talk room, but will have 6-ish seats.

### What to talk about?

Talks are informal and can be on (almost) any topic you like, loosely themed around technology.
The best talks are those that are made accessible/appeal to the diverse audience (Talks can still be technical and 'Infomazing' but should consider the audience).
A PowerPoint isn't required. Talks can be off the cuff, on the spot, interactive, more like a discussion session.
The best talks are those that a driven by raw passion, interest and excitement rather than reading from a script.

### Food and drink

* Refreshments are provided free of charge thanks to members of our community donating.
* Lunch is at 1pm.
    * There will be vegan and vegetarian options available.
    * (As this an event that is run on community donations, we may not be able to cater for all specialist dietary needs)

## What to bring

### Swap Shop

There will be a _table of wonder_. The Swap Shop.
Help yourself to free items at the "Swap Shop"!

If you have any small working components, items or tools you think anyone else could use for any projects please bring them to the event for the Swap Shop.

### Exhibits

We love it when people bring interesting items or things they have constructed.
Feel free to bring items you want to demo/exhibit.
This year, because space is limited, consider bringing smaller items.
