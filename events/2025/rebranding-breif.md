### Canterbury organizations logos

* ![Canterbury Council Logo](https://www.canterbury.gov.uk/sites/default/files/logo.png)
    * Cutout of canterbury cathedral

## Logo requirements

* We want
    * Primarily "Identity"
        * Logo (shape design)
        * Colour palette (2 or 3 colours?)
        * Typography guidelines
    * Secondarily (for another downstream project)
        * Guidance with website design, layout, identity, message and impact
        * It seems to be difficult to convey what BarCamp Canterbury is. People remark that the website does not help them 'get it'. The wording on the website has been repeatedly refined. Perhaps the concept does take some reading and time to comprehend and cannot be shortcutted?

* Logo
    * Logo 1:1 (square)
    * Logo + Text 4:1?
    * Mono + 2(or3) colour version
* Logo: intended use
    * Website (favicon) 1:1 small
    * Website Banner 4:1? Logo + text
    * Laser cut into badges? - used on lanyards?
* Website
    * Single page (mobile responsive)
    * Link Preview 2:1? (Logo and date of event?)


## Other considerations
* Can the logo be represented by a simple set of lines (e.g. cut into a badge? gradients may have to omitted in some versions)
* Can it be updated each year? Can a year be added to the logo and updated in an SVG?
* The current logo colour was chosen at almost random. It does not have to be ued, but could be to continue the legacy.

## Ideas
* Colours that come to mind
    * Sandy yellow of the cathedral stonework
    * Grey stone of Westgate towers and the city wall
