Thinks to do better next year:
 * Wifi
 * Make it clear on the flyer that it's ticketed.
 * Food quanitities
 * £££ - Try to break even

Feedback from attendees:

 * Bring more order to food-times with regards to queuing and placement of utensils etc.
 * Separate meat from veg more clearly.
 * More fruit (attendee bought apples for the event).
 * Bring AV cables (we did, but didn't advertise it).
