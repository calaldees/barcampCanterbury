Code of Conduct
===============

BarCamps should create an open and welcoming environment so that all of our attendees feel able to participate while being safe.

We do not tolerate harassment of unconference participants in any form.
Unconference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the unconference at the discretion of the BarCamp volunteers.

* Respect others

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Persistent uninvited criticism of a talk or a BarCamp volunteer
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Content is generated by attendees. We expect talks on a wide range of topics with a wide range of opinions. We do not control or endorse any content.


Enforcement
